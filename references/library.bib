abstract = {TensorFlow is a machine learning system that operates at large scale and in heterogeneous environments. TensorFlow uses dataflow graphs to represent computation, shared state, and the operations that mutate that state. It maps the nodes of a dataflow graph across many machines in a cluster, and within a machine across multiple computational devices, including multicore CPUs, general-purpose GPUs, and custom designed ASICs known as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). This architecture gives flexibility to the application developer: whereas in previous "parameter server" designs the management of shared state is built into the system, TensorFlow enables developers to experiment with novel optimizations and training algorithms. TensorFlow supports a variety of applications, with particularly strong support for training and inference on deep neural networks. Several Google services use TensorFlow in production, we have released it as an open-source project, and it has become widely used for machine learning research. In this paper, we describe the TensorFlow dataflow model in contrast to existing systems, and demonstrate the compelling performance that TensorFlow achieves for several real-world applications.},

abstract = {A computer data bank containing information on crater sizes, locations, and morphologies for all craters visible on Mariner 9 wide-angle mapping photography was used to construct a crater morphologic classification. Four general classes were constructed that can be interpreted to represent increasing degrees of crater degradation. Fresh class craters are nearly unmodified and consist of deep bowl-shaped craters and deep, flat-floored craters with terraced walls. The slightly modified class consists of deep flat-floored craters that usually have raised rims, but lack the terracing, central peaks, and hummocky floors indicative of unmodified impact crater morphology. Craters in the modified class are rimless and shallow and those in the ghost class are rimless and extremely shallow. Retention ages for fresh (i.e. unmodified) class craters on equatorial cratered terrain range from millions to billions of years, depending on the impact flux history used. If the trend is toward billions of years, then present degradation rates on Mars are low relative to earlier history and most craters in the degraded classes were probably modified in an early ({\textgreater}3.3 b.y.?) period. {\textcopyright} 1974.},

abstract = {Martian impact craters provide insights into formation ages of terrain units, nearsurface properties, and the planet's degradational history. Crater size-frequency distribution analyses allow determination of terrain unit relative ages, and extrapolation of the lunar crater chronology can provide estimates of absolute ages for these units. Such analyses indicate that Mars has been geologically active throughout its history, but it also retains extensive regions dating back to ca. 4 Ga. Higher cratering rates during the Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB) helped to create the Martian regolith, and formation of large impact basins helped to erode the initially denser Martian atmosphere and may have created the hemispheric dichotomy. Low global degradation rates since the end of LHB (ca. 3.8 Ga) resulted in well-preserved impact crater morphologies. The presence of layered ejecta blankets and central pits associated with fresh to moderately eroded craters suggests a volatile-rich crust. Impact crater depth-diameter relationships allow estimation of the vertical extent of crustal volatiles to depths greater than those probed by current spacecraft instrumentation. Temporal changes in subsurface ice reservoir depths are revealed by differences in layered ejecta onset diameter as a function of crater age. An understanding of the morphology and morphometry of pristine impact craters facilitates efforts to determine the amount and types of degradation and the periods over which they operated. Impact craters therefore play a major role in unraveling},

abstract = {Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) and Mars Odyssey data are being used to revise the Catalog of Large Martian Impact Craters. Analysis of data in the revised catalog provides new details on the distribution and morphologic details of 6795 impact craters in the northern hemisphere of Mars. This report focuses on the ejecta morphologies and central pit characteristics of these craters. The results indicate that single-layer ejecta (SLE) morphology is most consistent with impact into an ice-rich target. Double-layer ejecta (DLE) and multiple-layer ejecta (MLE) craters also likely form in volatile-rich materials, but the interaction of the ejecta curtain and target-produced vapor with the thin Martian atmosphere may be responsible for the large runout distances of these ejecta. Pancake craters appear to be a modified form of double-layer craters where the thin outer layer has been destroyed or is unobservable at present resolutions. Pedestal craters are proposed to form in an icerich mantle deposited during high obliquity periods from which the ice has subsequently sublimated. Central pits likely form by the release of vapor produced by impact into ice-soil mixed targets. Therefore, results from the present study are consistent with target volatiles playing a dominant role in the formation of crater morphologies found in the Martian northern hemisphere.},

abstract = {A revised Martian relative chronology is determined which dates geologic units with respect to the end of the period of heavy bombardment. This analysis differs from previous studies by using Viking 1:2M photomosaics to map all 25,826 craters ≥8km diameter which postdate the lithologic units making up the Martian surface. The relative plotting technique is used because it shows changes in the shape and density of the crater size-frequency distribution curves more clearly than cumulative plots. The changes in shapes of the distribution curves are interpreted to be due to two different impacting populations, one dominating during the heavy bombardment period and the other emplaced during the post heavy bombardment period. The 8-km-diameter limit was chosen to exclude the majority of secondary craters and to minimize obliteration effects acting over the age of the planet. The results obtained are average ages valid for units with typical thicknesses between about 1 and 3 km and extending over an area of about 105km2. The shapes and densities of the crater distribution curves indicate that approximately 60{\%} of the Martian lithologic units in which these craters occur formed during the period of heavy bombardment. Many of the small volcanoes (those generally less than 200 km diameter), including most in the Tharsis and Elysium regions, date from this period. The Hellas and Argyre impacts bracket the average age of the intercrater plains in the highlands. The ridged plains distribution curves indicate formation during the period of heavy bombardment, but their lower crater density indicates that they are the last geologic unit to retain the scars from this population of impactors. They therefore likely formed near the end of heavy bombardment. The remaining 40{\%} of Martian terrain units show distribution curves indicative of emplacement since the end of heavy bombardment. The wide range in crater densities among different regions of plains indicate a range in formation ages. Although the general view of Martian geologic evolution does not differ significantly from previous studies, the present analysis explicitly states the relationship of numerous geologic units to the period of heavy bombardment and has revised the relative ages of localized regions across Mars. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

abstract = {The premise of this study is that global analysis of crater morphologies can discriminate between the effects of impact energy, atmosphere, and subsurface volatiles based on the correlation between morphology and latitude, diameter, and terrain. This study focuses on seven ejecta and nine interior morphologies associated with 3819 craters ≥8 km in diameter distributed across the entire Martian surface. This data set is sufficiently large to provide statistically viable results on a global scale. The results of the analyses indicate that changes in ejecta and interior morphology correlate with increases in crater diameter. Excavation depths corresponding to these diameters are calculated from depth-diameter relationships and are compared to the theoretical distribution of subsurface volatiles. The different ejecta morphologies can be described by impact into material with varying proportions of volatiles, and the latidudinal variations seen for rampart crater morphologies correlate well with the proposed latitude-depth relationship for ice and brines across the planet. Many of the interior structres show distributions indicative of terrain-dependent influences: for example, the concentrations of central pit craters around ancient impact basins and on Alba Patera suggest that volatiles preferentially collect in these areas. However, central peak and peak ring interior morphologies show little relationship to planetary properties and probably result from changes in impact energy. Thus, many of the unique morphologies associated with Martian impact craters result from the presence of subsurface volatiles. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

abstract = {Fresh Martian impact craters display a variety of ejecta blanket morphologies. The fluidized appearance of most fresh ejecta types is commonly ascribed to heating and vaporization of subsurface volatiles during crater formation. We have conducted a study of the distribution of the three dominant fluidized ejecta morphologies (single layer ejecta (SLE), double layer ejecta (DLE), and multiple layer ejecta (MLE)) within the ±60 latitude zone on Mars. We have subdivided this region into 5 5 latitude-longitude boxes and have computed the following for each box: (1) percentage of craters showing any ejecta morphology as a function of total number of craters, (2) percentage of SLE craters as a function of craters with an ejecta morphology, (3) percentage of DLE craters as a function of craters with an ejecta morphology, and (4) percentage of MLE craters as a function of craters with an ejecta morphology. We confirm previous reports that the SLE morphology is the most common ejecta type within the study area, constituting {\textgreater}70{\%} of all ejecta morphologies over most of the study area. The DLE and MLE morphologies are much less common, but these morphologies are concentrated in localized regions of the planet. Using these results, we discuss how subsurface volatile reservoirs may be distributed across the planet. The regional variations found in this study generally correlate with the proposed locations of near-surface H2O reservoirs detected by Mars Odyssey},

abstract = {This paper introduces a network for volumetric segmentation that learns from sparsely annotated volumetric images. We outline two attractive use cases of this method: (1) In a semi-automated setup, the user annotates some slices in the volume to be segmented. The network learns from these sparse annotations and provides a dense 3D segmentation. (2) In a fully-automated setup, we assume that a representative, sparsely annotated training set exists. Trained on this data set, the network densely segments new volumetric images. The proposed network extends the previous u-net architecture from Ronneberger et al. by replacing all 2D operations with their 3D counterparts. The implementation performs on-the-fly elastic deformations for efficient data augmentation during training. It is trained end-to-end from scratch, i.e., no pre-trained network is required. We test the performance of the proposed method on a complex, highly variable 3D structure, the Xenopus kidney, and achieve good results for both use cases.},

Extracting craters is one of the fundamental tasks in planetary research. Although many automated crater detection algorithms have been developed to exact craters from image or topographic data, most of them are applicable only in particular regions, and only a few can be widely used, especially in complex surface settings. In this study, we present a machine learning approach to crater detection from topographic data. This approach includes two steps: detecting square regions which contain one crater with the use of a boosting algorithm and delineating the rims of the crater in each square region by local terrain analysis and circular Hough transform. A new variant of Haar-like features (scaled Haar-like features) is proposed and combined with traditional Haar-like features and local binary pattern features to enhance the performance of the classifier. Experimental results with the use of Mars topographic data demonstrate that the developed approach can significantly decrease the false positive detection rate while maintaining a relatively high true positive detection rate even in challenging sites.},

abstract = {ESA's Mars Express has successfully completed its nominal mission of one Martian year covering about 25{\%} of the surface in stereo and color with resolutions up to 10 m/pixel by its high-resolution stereo camera (HRSC). Mars Express is now in its extended mission phase, during which much of the remaining part of the Martian surface is envisaged to be covered in stereo and color. The HRSC instrument is designed to map the morphology, topography, structure and geologic context of the surface as well as atmospheric phenomena. This paper discusses the measurement principles and operations of the instrument as well as the acquisition, calibration and processing of regional and global data sets. As HRSC is a push-broom scanning instrument with nine CCD line detectors mounted in parallel on a focal plane, its unique feature is the ability to obtain near-simultaneous imaging data at high resolution, with along-track triple stereo, four colors and five different phase angles, avoiding any time-dependent variations of the observing conditions. The HRSC spatial resolution is 10 m/pixel at the nominal periapsis altitude of 250 km, with an image swath of 53 km, and 2.3 m/pixel for an additional framing CCD device, called super resolution channel (SRC), practically working as an additional tenth channel of the HRSC and yielding nested-in black and white images for studies of small-scale geologic features. The sub-pixel accuracy of the three-dimensional point determination allows the derivation of digital terrain models (DTMs) with a grid size of up to 50 m and a height accuracy of a single pixel with up to 10 m, thus enabling us to carry out detailed quantitative analyses of the surface structure. The HRSC (1) bridges the gap between the medium-high-resolution Viking imagery and the very-high-resolution Global Surveyor mission, thus providing geological context, and (2) fills the gaps in the three-dimensional coverage and DTM grid of the MOLA laser altimetry data, and (3) helps characterize landing sites for in-situ measurements. HRSC also builds the basis for extended compositional mapping when combining spectral information with topographic photomaps over large areas. So far the HRSC measurements have made a significant contribution to the study of the evolution of volcanism and the role of water and ice throughout the Martian history. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We have generated a new, 384,343-entry global crater database of Mars, statistically complete for craters with diameters D {\&}{\#}8805; 1 km. In this release, the database contains detailed morphologic and morphometric data for craters D {\&}{\#}8805; 3 km (future releases will extend these to smaller diameters). With detailed topographic data for the largest crater database to-date, we analyzed crater depth-to-diameter ratios for simple and complex morphologies across various terrains and for the planet as a whole and investigated the simple-to-complex morphology transition. Our results are similar to those in the published literature, but we found a substantial terrain dependence of the simple-to-complex transition that occurs at {\&}{\#}8764;11-km-diameter craters at high latitudes. This suggests a model that requires melting of volatiles during high-latitude crater formation that fill the crater during the modification phase but will still support the simple morphology to larger diameters. We also use this database to reexamine previously observed distributions and patterns to show its fidelity and to further explore other global relationships of fresh craters, those with central peaks, pits, and summit pits. We present the global distribution of craters with different types of ejecta and morphometric properties. Overall, this database is shown to be comparable to previous databases where there is overlap and to be useful in extending prior work into new regimes.},

In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

abstract = {Recently, all the craters from the major currently available manually assembled catalogues have been merged into the catalogue with 57 633 known Martian impact craters (MA57633GT). In addition, the work on crater detection algorithm (CDA), developed to search for still uncatalogued impact craters using 1/128° MOLA data, resulted in MA115225GT. In parallel with this work another CDA has been developed which resulted in the Stepinski catalogue containing 75 919 craters (MA75919T). The new MA130301GT catalogue presented in this paper is the result of: (1) overall merger of MA115225GT and MA75919T; (2) 2042 additional craters found using ShenCastan based CDA from the previous work and 1/128° MOLA data; and (3) 3129 additional craters found using CDA for optical images from the previous work and selected regions of 1/256° MDIM, 1/256° THEMIS-DIR, and 1/256° MOC datasets. All craters from MA130301GT are manually aligned with all used datasets. For all the craters that originate from the used catalogues (Barlow, Rodionova, Boyce, Kuzmin, Stepinski) we integrated all the attributes available in these catalogues. With such an approach MA130301GT provides everything that was included in these catalogues, plus: (1) the correlation between various morphological descriptors from used catalogues; (2) the correlation between manually assigned attributes and automated depth/diameter measurements from MA75919T and our CDA; (3) surface dating which has been improved in resolution globally; (4) average errors and their standard deviations for manually and automatically assigned attributes such as position coordinates, diameter, depth/diameter ratio, etc.; and (5) positional accuracy of features in the used datasets according to the defined coordinate system referred to as MDIM 2.1, which incorporates 1232 globally distributed ground control points, while our catalogue contains 130 301 cross-references between each of the used datasets. Global completeness of MA130301GT is up to ∼D{\textless}2 km (it contains 85 783 such craters, while the smallest D is 0.924 km). This is a considerable improvement in comparison with the completeness of the Rodionova (∼10 km), Barlow (∼5 km) and Stepinski (∼3 km) catalogues. An accompanying result to the new catalogue is a contribution to the evaluation of CDAsthe following methods have been developed: (1) a new context-aware method for the advanced automated registration of craters with GT catalogues; (2) a new method for manual registration of newly found craters into GT catalogues; and (3) additional new accompanying methods for objective evaluation of CDAs using different datasets including optical images. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Crater detection algorithms (CDAs) are an important subject of the recent scientific research. A ground truth (GT) catalogue, which contains the locations and sizes of known craters, is important for the evaluation of CDAs in a wide range of CDA applications. Unfortunately, previous catalogues of craters by other authors cannot be easily used as GT. In this paper, we propose a method for integration of several existing catalogues to obtain a new craters catalogue. The methods developed and used during this work on the GT catalogue are: (1) initial screening of used catalogues; (2) evaluation of self-consistency of used catalogues; (3) initial registration from three different catalogues; (4) cross-evaluation of used catalogues; (5) additional registrations and registrations from additional catalogues; and (6) fine-tuning and registration with additional data-sets. During this process, all craters from all major currently available manually assembled catalogues were processed, including catalogues by Barlow, Rodionova, Boyce, Kuzmin, and our previous work. Each crater from the GT catalogue contains references to crater(s) that are used for its registration. This provides direct access to all properties assigned to craters from the used catalogues, which can be of interest even to those scientists that are not directly interested in CDAs. Having all these craters in a single catalogue also provides a good starting point for searching for craters still not catalogued manually, which is also expected to be one of the challenges of CDAs. The resulting new GT catalogue contains 57,633 craters, significantly more than any previous catalogue. From this point of view, GT-57633 catalogue is currently the most complete catalogue of large Martian impact craters. Additionally, each crater from the resulting GT-57633 catalogue is aligned with MOLA topography and, during the final review phase, additionally registered/aligned with 1/256° THEMIS-DIR, 1/256° MDIM and 1/256° MOC data-sets. Accordingly, the resulting GT-57633 catalogue can successfully be used as a part of the framework for evaluation of CDAs. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Crater counting on the Moon and other bodies is crucial to constrain the dynamical history of the Solar System. This has traditionally been done by visual inspection of images, thus limiting the scope, efficiency, and/or accuracy of retrieval. In this paper we demonstrate the viability of using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to determine the positions and sizes of craters from Lunar digital elevation maps (DEMs). We recover 92{\%} of craters from the human-generated test set and almost double the total number of crater detections. Of these new craters, 15{\%} are smaller in diameter than the minimum crater size in the ground-truth dataset. Our median fractional longitude, latitude and radius errors are 11{\%} or less, representing good agreement with the human-generated datasets. From a manual inspection of 361 new craters we estimate the false positive rate of new craters to be 11{\%}. Moreover, our Moon-trained CNN performs well when tested on DEM images of Mercury, detecting a large fraction of craters in each map. Our results suggest that deep learning will be a useful tool for rapidly and automatically extracting craters on various Solar System bodies.

abstract = {Population-density maps of craters in three size ranges (0.6 to 1.2 km, 4 to 10 km, and {\textgreater}20 km in diameter) were compiled for most of Mars from Mariner 9 imagery. These data provide: historical records of the eolian processes (0.6 to 1.2 km craters); stratigraphic, relative, and absolute timescales (4 to 10 km craters); and a history of the early postaccretional evolution of the uplands ({\textgreater} 20 km craters). Based on the distribution of large craters ({\textgreater}20 km diameters), Mars is divisible into two general classes of terrain, densely cratered and very lightly cratered-a division remarkably like the uplands-maria dichotomy of the moon. It is probable that this bimodal character in the density distribution of large craters arose from an abrupt transition in the impact flux rate from an early intense period associated with the tailing off of accretion to an extended quiescent epoch, not from a void in geological activity during much of Mars' history. Radio-isotope studies of Apollo lunar samples show that this transition occurred on the moon in a short time. The intermediate-sized craters (4 to 10 km diameter) and the small-sized craters (0.6 to 1.2 km diameter) appear to be genetically related. The smaller ones are apparently secondary impact craters generated by the former. Most of the craters in the larger of these two size classes appear fresh and uneroded, although many are partly buried by dust mantles. Poleward of the 40° parallels the small fresh craters are notably absent owing to these mantles. The density of small craters is highest in an irregular band centered at 20°S. This band coincides closely with (1) the zone of permanent low-albedo markings; (2) the "wind equator" (the latitude of zero net north or south transport at the surface); and (3) a band that includes a majority of the small dendritic channels. Situated in the southermost part of the equatorial unmantled terrain which extends from about 40°N to 40°S, this band is apparently devoid of even a thin mantle. Because this belt is also coincident with the latitutde of maximum solar insolation (periapsis occurs near summer solstice), we suggest that this band arises from the asymmetrical global wind patterns at the surface and that the band probably follows the latitude of maximum heating which migrates north and south from 25°N to 25°S within the unmantled terrain on a 50,000 year timescale. The population of intermediate-sized craters (4-10 km diameter) appears unaffected by the eolian mantles, at least within the ±45° latitudes. Hence the local density of these craters is probably a valid indicator of the relative age of surfaces generated during the period since the uplands were intensely bombarded and eroded. It now appears that the impact fluxes at Mars and the moon have been roughly the same over the last 4 b.y. because the oldest postaccretional, mare-like surfaces on Mars and the moon display about the same crater density. If so, the nearness of Mars to the asteroid belt has not generated a flux 10 to 25 times greater than the lunar flux. Whereas the lunar maria show a variation of about a factor of three in crater density from the oldest to the youngest major units, analogous surfaces on Mars show a variation between 30 and 50. This implies that periods of active eolian erosion, tectonic evolution, volcanic eruption, and possibly fluvial modification have been scattered throughout Martian history since the formation and degradation of the martian uplands and not confined to small, ancient or recent, epochs. These processes are surely active on the planet today. {\textcopyright} 1974.},

abstract = {This study presents an automated system for cataloging impact craters using the MOLA 128 pixels/degree digital elevation model of Mars. Craters are detected by a two-step algorithm that first identifies round and symmetric topographic depressions as crater candidates and then selects craters using a machine-learning technique. The system is robust with respect to surface types; craters are identified with similar accuracy from all different types of martian surfaces without adjusting input parameters. By using a large training set in its final selection step, the system produces virtually no false detections. Finally, the system provides a seamless integration of crater detection with its characterization. Of particular interest is the ability of our algorithm to calculate crater depths. The system is described and its application is demonstrated on eight large sites representing all major types of martian surfaces. An evaluation of its performance and prospects for its utilization for global surveys are given by means of detailed comparison of obtained results to the manually-derived Catalog of Large Martian Impact Craters. We use the results from the test sites to construct local depth-diameter relationships based on a large number of craters. In general, obtained relationships are in agreement with what was inferred on the basis of manual measurements. However, we have found that, in Terra Cimmeria, the depth/diameter ratio has an abrupt decrease at ∼38°S regardless of crater size. If shallowing of craters is attributed to presence of sub-surface ice, a sudden change in its spatial distribution is suggested by our findings. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.},
