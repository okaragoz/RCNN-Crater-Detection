# Crater Detection with RCN

This repository contains a notebook that demonstrates the implementation of an RCNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) model with pre-trained RESNET50_V2 backbone for detecting craters in satellite images. The project is designed to provide a hands-on experience with applying advanced computer vision techniques.

## Overview

The notebook guides you through the process of setting up the environment, preparing the dataset, defining the RCNN model, training the model, and evaluating its performance. The goal is to detect and localize craters in satellite imagery, which can be crucial for geological studies, planetary science research, and navigation.

## Installation

To run the notebook, you need to have Python installed on your machine, along with Jupyter Notebooks or JupyterLab. You also need to install the following dependencies:

- PyTorch
- torchvision
- Albumentations
- OpenCV
- pycocotools

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision albumentations opencv-python-headless pycocotools
```
